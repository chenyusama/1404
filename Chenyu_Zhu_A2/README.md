## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?

The whole project took me about 20 hours. Nearly half of the time is spent completing kivy functions. 4 hours Spend on documentation, plus 2 hours of formatting and error checking. The remaining 4 hours were spent on Complete the subject's programming.

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?

My favorite part is the kiwi part. I didn't know much about it at first. I did this part through W3school and learned a lot about classes on this website.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?

What I am most dissatisfied with is the reading of files and the programming of main, because the foundation is relatively weak and I need to spend a lot of time reviewing courseware.

## 4. What worked well in your development process?

I think I did a good job asking for help, I did a good job using the courseware and W3school content for this assignment, and did a lot of experimenting on programming I couldn't understand to get me to learn it.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?

Next time I will start my homework earlier, this time I started late and the problem of procrastination made my whole project rush.As well as a better understanding of programming languages and enhanced understanding of courseware.And then I will do it step by step slowly instead of completing the entire homework all at once.

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.

KivyDemos in GitHub is one of the resources I use. I ran all the demos and noticed that those might be useful for the project. I refer to those demos when I don't know how to write some part of the program. W3school is the site I visit to ask questions about coding.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.

The structure of Kv and the writing of Class are my main problems.Most of the time my Kv doesn't work and can't run files normally. Afterwards, I found the problems in the typography in the demo and slowly solved them, and the color setting was also a big challenge for me.

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.

Two classes are used in the program, the Book and BookCollection classes. The Book class is used in the a1_classes program, Both classes are used in Kivy projects. The use of classes makes the code shorter and clearer because I can call method instead of creating a new function.
